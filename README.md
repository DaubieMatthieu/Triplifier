# Triplifier

Project of the semester S5 for the module "Semantic web and Knowledge management" (II.3521)
of the Software specialty at Isep (year A3 (Master 2))


The goal is to develop a web tool that takes a CSV file as input and transforms it
into a file containing the equivalent RDF triples in a Turtle serialization.  
More details are available in the instruction document "/Mini projet triplifier - v12 - fr-en.pdf"

The chosen backend framework is Flask, it is a Python library allowing to easily create a web server.
Since the project is not very heavy, this technology seemed the most appropriate.
